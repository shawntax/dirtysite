Having released on ULTRA, Musical Freedom, Deadbeats, STMPD, SONY, Confession, Gud Vibrations, Dim Mak, Insomniac, Universal, Welcome, and more. It is clear he has established himself as one of the most highly sought after producers around. Praised by DJ Mag as one of “the latest and greatest DJs and producers rising to the top”, ALRT has continued to catch attention with anything he releases.\n\n\n\n##### Support:\n\n\n\n\n\n###### ►Cat Liu\n\nDirtynotsorry.com/artists/cat-liu\n\n\n\n\n\n###### ►Knives\n\nDirtynotsorry.com/artists/knives\n\n\n\n\n\n###### ►Legrant\n\nLinktr.ee/legrantmusic\n\n\n###### ►Bobby Raw\n\nLinktr.ee/djbobbyraw\n\n\n\n\n\n###### ►Cris Rocks\n\nInstagram.com/crisrocks.music\n\nSoundcloud.com/user-610447533\n\n\n\n\n\n###### ►Goddy\n\nInstagram.com/goddy_music\n\n\n\n\n\n###### ►Gomorrah Dawn\n\nInstagram.com/gomorrahdawn\n\nSoundcloud.com/gomorrahdawn\n\n\n###### ►DJ HK\n\nFlowcode.com/page/djhk\n"
