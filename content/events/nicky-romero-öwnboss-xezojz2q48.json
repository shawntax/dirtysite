  "description": "AN ELEVATED NIGHTLIFE EXPERIENCE\n\nOn Friday November 8th NICKY ROMERO + Special guest OWNBOSS & TIBURON takeover the historical Hibernia Bank building, which will be transformed into an audio and visual haven. \n\nNicky Romero has progressed from being a young, musical wunderkind to become one of the most influential artists of his time. As a DJ, producer and mogul whose label is at the forefront of modern electronic dance music, it goes without saying that Nicky is a force to be reckoned with.  \n\nNicky's resume boasts an impressive and lengthy discography of originals, remixes, edits and co-productions, proving again and again his ability to evolve with the ever-changing landscape of electronic music. Perhaps even more telling of his razor-sharp prowess and visionary mindset is the success and impact of his label Protocol Recordings, setting up recent collaborations with David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike.\n\n21+\n",
