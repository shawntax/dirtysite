  "description": "NO GUTS, NO GLORY: BOMBAYS is here to disrupt the status quo of dance music. He continues to infiltrate the house music industry with his cutting edge take on production, style and vibe as a whole. He’s stacked multiple performances at EDC, Hard Summer, Imagine Festival and more as he propels himself deeper into the scene.\n\nWith each release, you’ll find yourself reading between the lines of his dance floor-adjacent cuts and taking in the doom and gloom embedded into his signature sound; his catalog reaches beyond the scope of bass house and deep house, inviting mystery and thrilling emotions into his creative process for the ultimate listening experience.\n"
