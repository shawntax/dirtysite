  "description": "## Headliner:\n\n### **► Not Not**\n\n[Eventlink.to/notnotmusic](https://eventlink.to/notnotmusic)\n\nWhat started with banging a pair of drumsticks delivered by Santa Claus in 2006 transitioned to twisting synth knobs and jog-wheels in 2023. A lifelong musical journey has brought Not Not to the point he is at now. Breaking the Top 5 in Tech House and 25 overall with 3 of his EPs on Beatport. Having his music supported Kyle Watson, Matroda, Shiba San and other house heavyweights. Getting booked to play at Groove Cruise and FNGRS CRSSD parties or share the stage with Walker & Royce, Odd Mob, Black V Neck, San Pacho and many other similar sounding artists. With a healthy balance of original vocals to stand out and cleverly used samples, no two releases will be the same, but his distinct sound will ring true. Any listener can quickly catch the groove from the hefty bassline while playful percs or vocal chops dance on top. With larger bookings and a maturing discography on the horizon, it’s apparent Not Not is on the trajectory to climb fast and high.\n\n## Support:\n\n### **►Eyezick**\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/eyezick](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/eyezick)\n\n### **►Jaxx T**\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/jaxx-t](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/jaxx-t)\n\n### **►Concussions**\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/concussions](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/concussions)\n\n### **►Gallelli**\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/gallelli](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/gallelli)\n\n### **►Jurrasic Jan**\n\n[Linktr.ee/jurassicjan](https://linktr.ee/jurassicjan)\n\n### **►Zerodayz**\n\n[Instagram.com/zerodayzmusic](https://www.instagram.com/zerodayzmusic)\n\n[Soundcloud.com/zerodayz](https://soundcloud.com/zerodayz)\n\n### **►Chanse**\n\n[Linktr.ee/chansemusic](https://linktr.ee/chansemusic)\n"
