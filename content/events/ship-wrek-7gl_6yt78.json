  "description": "### Headliner:\n\n#### Ship Wrek\n\n[Hoo.be/shipwrek](https://hoo.be/shipwrek)\n\nLos Angeles-based duo Ship Wrek are known for their high-octane house beats and electrifying DJ sets that ignite dance floors. Infectious dance floor anthems like “Obsession” (with Valentino Khan) and the Dillon Francis collab “It’s My House” have earned them support from heavyweights like Skrillex, Zedd, and Tiësto. They’ve lit up festival stages from EDC Las Vegas to Bonnaroo, cementing their status as one of the electronic scene’s most dynamic and must-see acts.\n\n### Support:\n\n#### GVBE\n\n[Instagram.com/gvbefernvndez/](https://www.instagram.com/gvbefernvndez/)\n\n#### Concussions\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/concuss!ons](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/concuss!ons)\n\n#### Aanster B2B Mikey The Lad\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/aanster](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/aanster)\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/mikey-the-lad](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/mikey-the-lad)\n"
