  "description": "► No Mana\n\n\n[ihavenomanas.com](https://www.ihavenomanas.com)\n\n\nAs the production wizard from Southern California, No Mana has been practicing musical alchemy and sculpting a craft that has never seen the light of day. However, with the work let loose in the recent days, his music has gotten to the best of Eric Prydz, Dillon Francis and many more. In just under a year, he begins to release his material under Mau5trap and shows the world what he’s all about – voltaic electro house with influences from various four-to-the-floor genres, and styles from different years and stages of electronic music.\n\nSupport:\n\n► Knives\n\n\n[Linktr.ee/djknives](https://www.Linktr.ee/djknives)\n\n\n► Jero\n\n\n[Linktr.ee/officialjero](https://www.Linktr.ee/officialjero)\n\n"
