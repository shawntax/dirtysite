  "description": "Join us for the debut of our new party series DNBNS: Drum N Bas Not Sorry at the legendary F8 with headliner Slippy\n\nAlex Swartwout –better known by his stage name Slippy– is an electronic producer and DJ hailing from California. He began releasing music with Monstercat in 2015 and has quickly grown to become a widely-recognized figure in the bass music scene, known for his distinguished take on Drum & Bas as well as, Trap and Dubstep.\n\nSlippy’s signature sound can best be described as a riveting hybrid of genres with dark, sinister, orchestral-influenced undertones. Many of Swartwout’s originals lure listeners in with rich atmospheres and eerie melodies, but quickly shift things into high gear with fiery, energetic bass drops.\n\nOver the last 9 years as Slippy, Swartwout has performed at premiere festivals and venues such as EDC Las Vegas, Lost Lands, Forbidden Kingdom, and Avalon Hollywood, had music featured in Rocket League & Beat Saber (currently the best-selling VR game in the world), and completed production & score work for acts such as Baby Keem & pgLang (_The Melodic Blue: Baby Keem_, 2023), Gryffin, Bebe Rexha, Cheat Codes, and Riovaz.\n\n\n### Headliner:\n\n\n\n\n\n**► Slippy**\n\n\n[Linktr.ee/slippy_music](https://linktr.ee/slippy_music)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Support:\n\n\n\n\n\n**► Duchess B2B Corrine**\n\n\n[Linktr.ee/duchessofdnb](https://linktr.ee/duchessofdnb)\n\n\n\n[Instagram.com/corrineisadj](https://www.instagram.com/corrineisadj/)\n\n\n\n[Soundcloud.com/corrineisadj](https://soundcloud.com/corrineisadj)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**► Damasek**\n\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/damasek](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/damasek)\n\n\n► **Elevener B2B Willy Wonksta**\n\n\n[Linktr.ee/elevener](https://linktr.ee/Elevener)\n\n\n\n[Instagram.com/willy_wonksta](https://www.instagram.com/willy_wonksta/)\n\n\n\n[Soundcloud.com/willywonksta](https://soundcloud.com/willywonksta)\n\n\n### In the Lounge (Liquid D&B):\n\n\n\n\n\n► **Knives**\n\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/knives](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/knives)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n► **Legrant**\n\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/legrant](https://dirtynotsorry.com/artists/legrant)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n► **Kinetik**\n\n\n[Instagram.com/kinetikdnb](https://www.instagram.com/kinetikdnb)\n\n\n\n[Soundcloud.com/kinetik-dnb](https://soundcloud.com/kinetik-dnb)\n\n\n► **Ada Lovebass**\n\n\n[Instagram.com/adalovebass](https://www.instagram.com/adalovebass)\n\n\n\n[Soundcloud.com/adalovebass](https://soundcloud.com/adalovebass)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n► **Ritual X**\n\n\n[Instagram.com/followritualx](https://www.instagram.com/followritualx)\n\n\n\n[Soundcloud.com/followritualx](https://soundcloud.com/followritualx)\n\n"
