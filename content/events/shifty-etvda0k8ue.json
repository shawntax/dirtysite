  "description": "Ethan Ramos and Drey Despot aka Shifty are on of House music's newest talents, on the rise fresh out of Huntington Beach, California. With releases on Space Yacht, No Gimmicks, Rawsome Deep, Broke, and more, they're only scratching the surface of what is to come with their recent releases. Their song, \"Paddling Out\" released on North of Neptune, the funky brother label of Lee Foss’s Repopulate Mars, was a huge staple in helping them solidify their unparalleled approach to house music. Landing on Spotify’s Tech House Operator playlist, as well as on the USB's of Jamie Jones, MEDUZA, Marco Carola, Shiba San, and many more, this track has made waves in recent dance clubs all around the world (no pun intended).\n\n### Headliner: \n\n#### ► Shifty\n\n\n[Shifty.komi.io](https://Shifty.komi.io)\n\n\n### Support:\n\n#### ► Hansoo\n\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/hansoo](https://Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/hansoo)\n\n\n#### ► Eyezick\n\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/eyezick](https://Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/eyezick)\n\n\n#### ► Legrant\n\n\n[Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/eyezick](https://Dirtynotsorry.com/artists/eyezick)\n\n"
