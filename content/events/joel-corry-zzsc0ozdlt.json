  "description": "No one's doing it quite like Joel Corry. He's a hit machine who tops mainstream and underground charts, with five UK platinum records, including Number One single 'Head & Heart' with MNEK, and collaborations with Charli XCX, Mabel, RAYE, Tom Grennan, Bryson Tiller and David Guetta under his belt. Joel's signature is his earworm hooks and strong melodies that connect on an emotional level. It's an addictive sound that people keep coming back to, reflecting his ambition to make music that's timeless.\n\nAlthough a certified pop star, he's still a raver at heart, with his best memories made on dancefloors, and he holds down DJ residencies at some of the world's best clubs from Las Vegas to Ibiza alongside playing festivals from Ultra to Tomorrowland amid a relentless touring schedule. He never stays still: constantly evolving, hitting milestone after milestone in pop and dance music, and is always hungry for more.\n"
