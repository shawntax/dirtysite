  "bio": "San Francisco-based electronic dance music DJ known as Prizmatix is an ascending artist who is well-seasoned and multifaceted in not only music but acting, dancing. Her career and experience in the movie-making and theatre industry have given her the upper hand on what it takes to succeed in the music and entertainment industry.\n\nAmassing over one hundred stage performances and appearances, her ability to take center limelight in her craft is what separates her from the rest and rightfully so. Her multitude of nightclub and festival appearances has given her the opportunity to open for the likes of major touring acts and headliners such as Tritonal, Matroda, Tchami, and several others giving room to expand her versatility as a dance music icon in her regional area.\n\nHer opening and supporting slots have allowed her to make her presence known at music venues such as 1015 Folsom, Bergerac, PayPal Stadium, and Calypso. Cultivating smooth transitions across vocal-driven records with a high-energy bass house creates a high-energy environment for any dance floor.\n\nPrizmatix is on an upward trajectory to a highly- respected and coveted dance music position and leading a forefront example for female artists across the board. This is the age of Prizmatix and her time to illuminate is now.\n"
