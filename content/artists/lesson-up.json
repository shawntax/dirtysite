  "bio": "Alyssa Walter produces and spins under the name LYSSN UP and is based in San Francisco, California. LYSSN UP is new in the EDM space, but grew up playing bass guitar in a metal band (which is why she loves a good bassline). She's always been influenced and inspired by 80s synth and bass, so it was a natural transition when she started producing and DJing a couple years ago. Some of her biggest inspirations include a mix of artists including Boris Brejcha, Space 92, Joris Voorn, UMEK, Droplex, and Jay Lumen. Though she is a newer artist, her dedication to production quality and her ability to captivate a crowd will take her far in her music career. EVERYBODY LYSSN UP!\n"
