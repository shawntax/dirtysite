  "bio": "Robert Raya's childhood had a diverse soundtrack. His dad popped and locked in the living room to late-80s and early 90s electronic dance jams, and played smooth oldies on Sunday nights. His mom blasted modern R&B and Gospel, and his grandparents loved disco and hard-driving funk. As a producer, Robert brings to bear all these influences, with a fast growing collection of remixes and original works that have already made waves in the house scene.\n\nWith music supported by some of the biggest names in Tech House such as SIDEPIECE and Acraze, to having music played at some of the worlds biggest stages such as EDC, the future is near and bright for Robert Raya.\n\nTogether with his longtime DJ partner JERO, Robert has already taken over popular San Francisco Bay Area bars and clubs. His style, a celebration of culture, creativity and youth, continues to evolve, and he plays an addictive mix of House beats that retain the danceability and joy of the hits he grew up on.\n"
