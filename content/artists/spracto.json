  "bio": "Spracto went from the dancefloor to the DJ booth over the course of 2022 and hasn’t looked back since. His drive, commitment and intensity in pursuing his passion has earned him thousands of downloads on hypeddit, tens of thousands of streams on SoundCloud and Spotify as well as label releases with Wirlix records. With a style and taste for house music that lands between Minimal Tech and full blown Bass House; Spracto’s sound got him noticed right away in the crowded SF house music scene.\n"
