  "bio": "Melevate is a dynamic local DJ from San Francisco with a signature style encompassing genres such as Progressive House, Melodic Techno, and Trance.

Her sets are designed to amplify that connection, creating an environment where the energy and emotions flow together.\n\nMelevate performs at iconic SF venues such as Halcyon, Midway, 1015 Folsom, Audio, Hawthorn, Bergerac, The Phoenix Hotel, and more. Sharing the stage with Miss Monique, Oliver Smith, Luttrell, Qrion, Jordan Suckley, Nora Van Elken, Tokimonsta, Audien, Zoya, Jerome Isma-ae, Tita Lau, and Joplyn.
